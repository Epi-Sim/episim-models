This model was developed to simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus in Spain in 2020. The metapopulation is defined using the 52 provinces of Spain, into which the municipalities are agreggated.

##Provenance
The dataset used in this model is based on the study:
**Rebound in epidemic control: how misaligned vaccination timing amplifies infection peaks** by *Castioni, P. et al*.
The model implementation, parameters, and mobility data structure are aligned with the experiments presented in that publication
