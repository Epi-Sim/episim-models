NAME: COVID-19 Madrid Model for the MMCACovid19Vac engine.
DESCRIPTION: this model was developed to simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus in Madrid in 2020. The metapopulation is defined using 283 areas, which exceed the 179 municipalities in the region. Larger municipalities, such as the city of Madrid, are divided into several areas. Some areas correspond to a single municipality, while others cover a group of municipalities.
